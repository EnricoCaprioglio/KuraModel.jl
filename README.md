# Kuramodel

Package has not been registred yet so the easiest way to use this is to copy this repo in your `~/.julia/dev` folder.
Then, open Julia and install the package by specifying the path as follows:
```
  using Pkg
  Pkg.add(path="~/.julia/dev/Kuramodel.jl")
```

After this, the command `using Kuramodel` should work correctly.
To do a quick test, type:
```
  using Kuramodel
  greet()
```
and it should print the line
  `You are using the Kuramodel Package, have fun!`
